## Features
Features of this application include the users ability to generate a professional README.md document straight from the command line. The user will answer a series of prompts about their application, and then a README.md markdown file will be generated based on their responses. Features within the README.md file include a licensing badge which will be appended near the top of the page based on what license the user would like their application to be covered under. As well as a table of contents which includes links to the various sections of the README.md document, that when clicked take the user to the corresponding section. Lastly their is a questions section at the bottom of the generated README.md document where links to the application authors GitHub and email are provided (when clicked, the user will be taken to the authors GitHub account, or to a blank email document where the author is automatically entered as the recipient).
